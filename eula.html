   <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 15/05/2025</p>
   <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE HFLOW UI PACKAGE.</p>
   <p>
      By purchasing, downloading, or using the HFLOW UI Houdini package (the "Software"), you — whether an individual or a legal entity such as a studio or company (the "User") — agree to be bound by the terms of this End User License Agreement ("Agreement") with Matthis Bozec (the "Licensor"). This agreement applies from the date of installation of the Software.
   </p>
   <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
   <p></p>
      The Licensor grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the Software. For personal users, the Software may be used freely in any personal or commercial project, as long as it is not resold, redistributed, or transferred. Individual users are permitted to install the Software on multiple computers, provided that it is only used by the same person. For studios and professional environments, the Software is licensed on a per-seat basis (per machine or per user) and may be used in internal pipelines, freelance work, films, TV, streaming media, advertisements, and any other commercial content.
   </p>

   </p>
   <h2>4. License Transfer</h2>

   </p>
   <h2>5. Ownership</h2>
   <p>
      The Creator retains full ownership, copyright, and intellectual property rights of the Software. This Agreement does not grant the User any ownership interest in the Software.

      Updates and bug fixes are included with the original purchase. Updates are distributed through Gumroad. Support is provided on a best-effort basis via email at

   </p>
   <h2>8. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
   <p>
      The Software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Your exclusive remedy under the above limited warranty shall be, at our option, either a full refund of the purchase price or correction of the defective software or media. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all liability for indirect or consequential damages that arise under this license agreement.

   <h2>11. Confidentiality</h2>
   <p>
      The Software does not transmit or collect any user data or project content. While it may store local data (such as node usage information) on the User's computer to support certain features, this data is not accessed, transmitted, or collected by the Licensor. The Licensor agrees not to access or monitor user projects or files in any way. Any feedback or bug reports shared with the Licensor shall be treated as confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties.

   </p>
   <h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>
   <p>
      This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between the User and the Licensor regarding the Software and supersedes any prior agreements, communications, or understandings, whether oral or written.
